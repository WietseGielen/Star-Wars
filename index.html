                    Turmoil has engulfed the
                    Galactic Republic. The taxation
                    of trade routes to outlying star
                    systems is in dispute.
                    <br><br>
                    Hoping to resolve the matter
                    with a blockade of deadly
                    battleships, the greedy Trade
                    Federation has stopped all
                    shipping to the small planet
                    of Naboo.
                    <br><br>
                    While the Congress of the
                    Republic endlessly debates
                    this alarming chain of events,
                    the Supreme Chancellor has
                    secretly dispatched two Jedi
                    Knights, the guardians of
                    peace and justice in the
                    galaxy, to settle the conflict....

                    There is unrest in the Galactic
                    Senate. Several thousand solar
                    systems have declared their
                    intentions to leave the Republic.
                    <br><br>
                    This separatist movement,
                    under the leadership of the
                    mysterious Count Dooku, has
                    made it difficult for the limited
                    number of Jedi Knights to maintain
                    peace and order in the galaxy.
                    <br><br>
                    Senator Amidala, the former
                    Queen of Naboo, is returning
                    to the Galactic Senate to vote
                    on the critical issue of creating
                    an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC
                    to assist the overwhelmed
                    Jedi....

                <p>
                    War! The Republic is crumbling
                    under attacks by the ruthless
                    Sith Lord, Count Dooku.
                    There are heroes on both sides.
                    Evil is everywhere.
                    <br><br>
                    In a stunning move, the
                    fiendish droid leader, General
                    Grievous, has swept into the
                    Republic capital and kidnapped
                    Chancellor Palpatine, leader of
                    the Galactic Senate.
                    <br><br>
                    As the Separatist Droid Army
                    attempts to flee the besieged
                    capital with their valuable
                    hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a
                    desperate mission to rescue the
                    captive Chancellor....
