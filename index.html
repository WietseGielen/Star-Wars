                    Luke Skywalker has vanished.
                    In his absence, the sinister
                    FIRST ORDER has risen
                    from the ashes of the Empire
                    and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi,
                    has been destroyed.

                    With the support of the REPUBLIC,
                    General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE.
                    She is desperate to find her
                    brother Luke and gain his
                    help in restoring peace and
                    justice to the galaxy.

                    pilot on a secret mission
                    to Jakku, where an old ally

                    <br><br>
                    The FIRST ORDER reigns. Having decimated the peaceful Republic, 
                    Supreme Leader Snoke now deploys his merciless legions to 
                    seize military control of the galaxy.

                    Only General Leia Organa’s band of RESISTANCE fighters stand against
                    the rising tyranny, certain that Jedi Master Luke Skywalker will return 
                    and restore a spark of hope to the fight.

                    As the First Order speeds toward the rebel base, the brave heroes 
                    mount a desperate escape....
